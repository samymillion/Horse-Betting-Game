This class creates and modifies instances of \doxylink{class_bet}{Bet} objects when the user interacts with the betting interface in the game. It allows the user to enter a bet, select a horse to bet on, place a bet, update the money pool, check the bet result after a race, and display betting history. Primarily, features that were meant to be implemented sequentially are included in this file.
